TO DO
------

1. Make boundaries block. Perhaps keep loc from updating if hitting a wall. In that case, no need for physical walls, just boundary lists.
   * VERY difficult. rect_name.move(offset, offset)
   * Make a rect list and use rect_name.collidelist()

2. Try to make title screen

3. Make more rooms, inventory array, openable menu?

4. Networking?
